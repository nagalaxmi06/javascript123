    promise :
A promise is special js object that represent the eventual completion 
Its allow to handle asnchronces tasks more effective than callbacks
Three states:
1)pending: in the inital states  still waiting for the operation  to finish 
2)fulfilled: the operation is completed successfully
3)rejected: the operation is failed

Exp:
1)to create a promise:
New promise()
Two parameters
Resolve- to mark the promise as successfully
Reject- to mark as failed
2) to handling the result:
.Then()method is called when the promise is fulfilled
It will receives the result from resolves()
.catch(): method is called if the promise  is rejected is receives a error messages from reject()*/
/*let mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;
    if (success) {
        resolve();
    } else {
        reject();
    }
});
mypromise.then(() => {
    console.log("Success");
    document.write("Success");
})
mypromise.catch(() => {
    console.log("Failed");
    document.write("Failed");
});
//Chnaging promises
        /* let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
             resolve(5);
            //initial resolve value is 5
        })
         promise 
         .then(result=>{
            console.log(result);
           return result*2
            //return a new value
        })
        .then(result=>{

            console.log("error",error);
         })
